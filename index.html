      <h2>Science</h2>
      As a young person in school I enjoyed the Sciences and Math but I was always middling in English and communication oriented skills. I had an eclectic taste in interests - I wanted to grow up to be an Aerospace Engineer or maybe an Oceanographer.
      <h2>Techology</h2>
        I've always been a technophile and loved to read National Geographic, Science and Popular Mechanics Magazines about the latest science and tech breaktroughs.
      <h2>Aquatic Life</h2>
      My favorite animal was the <em>Octopus vulgaris</em> the Common Octopus - because of their alien biology compared to ours. Did you know they have <b>Nine Brians</b>?!
