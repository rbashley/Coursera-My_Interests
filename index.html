      <h2>Science</h2><img src="https://images.all-free-download.com/images/graphiclarge/saturn_planet_saturns_rings_223425.jpg" />
      I have always been fascinated by the Sciences and the natural world. I remember as a child being fascinated by the planets and the stars. I wanted to be an Astronomer or Astrophysicist.
      <h2>Techology</h2>
        I've always been a technophile and loved to read National Geographic, Science and Popular Mechanics Magazines about the latest science and tech breaktroughs.
      <h2>Aquatic Life</h2>
      My favorite animal was the <em>Octopus vulgaris</em> the Common Octopus - because of their alien biology compared to ours. Did you know they have <b>Nine Brians</b>?!
